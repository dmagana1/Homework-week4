In this project our goal was to create a test/quiz that had a working timer and had multiple choice questions. The quiz that I created was about code, and it had various questions with A,B,C,D, button to push; once the answer was pushed a pop would come up telling you if the answer was correct. At the end it will ask for your initals, and show you your highscore. In the Picture Folders I placed screenshots of my project, because I dont know how to add them to the readme file, and I also dont know how to setup a working url, so that you are able to test it out the project. 


## Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
```

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
